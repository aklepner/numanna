  <li>
  <div class="slider-container">
  <p>"I have tried several different brands of storable foods and NuManna has been the best. The food looks like actual food. Although it was difficult to pick a favorite as all are delicious...makes my mouth salivate just typing about it! Thank you NuManna for making incredible food!"</p>

  <div class="slider-container">
  <p>"I really appreciate the high quality non GMO products you carry and I especially like the packaging. Very professional to say the least. I really like spicy chili and your habanero chili is the best, in my opinion. Thanks for the custom order.<br />
  You make it so that having an emergency supply doesn't have to feel like I'm "roughing it" so thanks for that! I've had to reorder since I sometimes enjoy Numanna even in the good times..."</p>

  <li>
  <div class="slider-container">
  <p>"I was very surprised after eating NuManna. First it tastes great. Second, most storable foods give me a bit of an uneasy feeling after eating them. I have food sensitivities. I did not experience any of the typical stomach problems for eating a dehydrated food product. NuManna is the best I have ever had."</p>

  <h4>— Tim C., California</h4>

  <div class="slider-container">
  <p>"This stuff is awesome. My wife has been away for a while so I ate NuManna while she was gone. It was simple and everything I had was really good. I wish NuManna was around when I bought a bunch of bulk food in the past from the Mormons. I don’t want to have all these ingredients and put them together. NuManna was simple and great tasting. I gave away all my other bulk food."</p>

  <h4>— Reagan B., Mexico</h4>

  </li>
  <li>
  <div class="slider-container">
  <p>"I host a national radio show and I have been around this industry for a long time and seen just about everything that is out there. I have never tasted storable food as good as NuManna and I’ll put my name on that. My wife and I took some of the Pasta Primavera to a church function and people couldn’t believe this was storable food. It was so creamy. The Habanero chili could win a cook-off it’s that good. NuManna is the brand we recommend because it is the best we have ever tasted and the People behind the company are first rate."</p>

  <h4>— Pastor Butch, West Virginia</h4>

  <li>
  <div class="slider-container">
  <p>"I’ve been in search of a storable food product that would help you and your family. I’ve tested a number of products and I’ve researched a number of companies and I actually have finally come up with a company and a product line that I believe that you need to utilize to help protect yourself and your family. The name of the company is NuManna."</p>

  <p>"I received the sampler pack last week and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food is. The portion size was perfect for both my husband and I to try. His comment was, ‘this is actually really good tasting’. Also, the fact that this is non-gmo food is a major plus! We will definitely be ordering from you again. Thank you so much for a great product, and offering the sample packs to try."</p>
